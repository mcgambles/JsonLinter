 This script performs validation on JSON files in the "AppTemplatesJson" directory based on a predefined schema. Let's break down the script step by step:

Regular Expression Patterns:

The compile_category_pattern function compiles a regular expression pattern that validates the "Category" field in the JSON files. It allows uppercase words and excludes only "and" in lowercase.
The compile_name_pattern function compiles a regular expression pattern that validates the "Name" field in the JSON files. It ensures that the field is not empty.
JSON Schema:

The load_json_schema function defines a JSON schema with the following properties:
"Name": A non-empty string with a minimum length of 1, validated using the compile_name_pattern.
"Generic": A boolean.
"Category": A non-empty string with a minimum length of 1, validated using the compile_category_pattern.
The schema also specifies that "Name" is a required property.
Validation Function:

The search_and_validate_json function performs the following tasks:
It identifies the current working directory and constructs the path to the "AppTemplatesJson" directory.
Checks if the directory exists and is indeed a directory. If not, it prints an error and exits.
Retrieves a list of JSON files in the "AppTemplatesJson" directory.
Reads an ignore list from a file specified by the ignore_file parameter.
Iterates through each JSON file, checking if it is in the ignore list. If so, it skips validation for that file.
Checks if the file is empty. If so, it prints an error and exits.
Reads the JSON file and parses its content.
Uses the defined schema to validate the parsed JSON using the jsonschema library.
If validation fails, it prints an error message along with details of the validation errors and exits.
If validation passes, it increments the validated count.
If any unexpected exception occurs during the process, it prints an error message and exits.
Main Function:

The main function sets the path to the ignore list file and calls the search_and_validate_json function.
Script Execution:

The script checks if it is being executed directly (__name__ == "__main__") and calls the main function in that case.
Output:

The script prints various messages indicating the validation process, including success or failure for each file.
In summary, this script is designed to validate a collection of JSON files against a predefined schema, skipping files listed in an ignore list, and providing detailed error messages if validation fails. It is primarily intended for validating JSON files in the "AppTemplatesJson" directory.
